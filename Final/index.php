            <h3>Some Background</h3>
            <p>
                As many of you can relate, quarentine times this past year were very tough, with nearly no socializing possible. 
                Like many others, I found myself gravitating towards caring for planets and expanding my collection. As the number 
                of planets I obtained grew, my lonelyness seemed to slightly minimize. And so, I have decided to share some of my 
                favorite planets with you!

            <h3>Reasons for my obession</h3>
            <p>
                One of the important aspects of planets that appealed to me so much during quarentine was the purpose they gave me. 
                Some require more attention than others, but in general having to maintain them was a good task that made me keep track
                of the days and distracted me from all the sadness. They also bring life into any room and provide an easy decorative
                element indoors. Keeping them alive is so rewarding and makes me feel capable of taking care of another form of life.
